# Cyber-Security-Portfolio

As I embark on my journey in the field of cybersecurity, my initial role as an analyst is an exciting step in my career. I bring to this role strong verbal and written communication skills, a keen eye for detail, and a commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards.

My values, centered around protecting people and organizations while adhering to laws and ethics, are at the core of my work as an analyst. I am passionate about helping individuals and organizations safeguard their sensitive information and contribute to their overall security.

Looking ahead, my long-term aspiration is to become an ethical hacker. To achieve this, I am proactively pursuing certifications such as the Google Cybersecurity Certification and Security+ as the foundational building blocks. Over the next 12 to 18 months, I plan to advance my skills further with certifications like the EJPT and, ultimately, either the PNPT or OSCP.

I am committed to continuous learning and self-improvement, recognizing that these efforts benefit both me and the organizations I serve. As I progress in my career, I am dedicated to contributing my evolving expertise to enhance cybersecurity strategies and protect against evolving threats.
